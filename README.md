# Solo Project - YOUR COLORWAY

## Problem
Do you ever wonder how the seniors make such pretty PowerPoints? 
Do you ever wonder how they come up with such amazing color schemes??
Do you ever have difficulty picturing certain colors together to see if they work?

## Solution
YOUR COLORWAY will allow you to select unique colors and see them side by side!

## Technical Challenges
- Front end renders but back end unable to GET/POST saved color ways in our PostgreSQL (elephantSQL) database. 
- Initially, the plan was to be able to DELETE specific colors, but it wouldn’t work. So I tried changing it to deleting the most recent color added, but ultimately I couldn’t get my state to update correctly.

## Stretch Goals
- Be able to save color ways
- Be able to delete specific colors
- Auto-populate the input field with hex color code from picker
- Multiple users/login to view your stored combinations
